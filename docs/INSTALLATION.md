# Installation

You will need the Node.js version 22 or greater, along with Node Package Manager (npm) to install and use ReScript. NPM comes preinstalled with Node, but you can use alternative package managers if you so wish.

To install Node, follow the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). It is recommended that you use a library version manager such as [nvm](https://www.nvmnode.com/), [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), or [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), so that you can switch between Node versions as required.

Once you have install Node.js and your package manaer, install ReScript and all required dependencies for the exercise by running:

```
npm install install
```

ReScript has integration for a number of editors, see [here](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/editor-plugins)

Some command line tools (including a REPL allowing you to evaluate ReScript expressions in a shell) can be found [here](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/installation)
